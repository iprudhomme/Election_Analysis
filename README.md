# Election_Analysis
## Overview 
For our third project in the Data Analytics course, we've been given some election results by the election commission in Colorado and asked to audit the results.  We have created a Python script to open the file with the election results, loop through it and get the results for each candidate and county, then display to the screen the candidates and counties, their percentages of the total votes, declare the county with the largest count of votes, and declare the winner of the election.  As well, we are outputting the election results to a text file to submit to the election commission.

## Election-Audit Results

Using our audit program, here are the determined results for the election:
* Total votes cast:  369,711 
* County Votes:
    * Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
    * Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
    * Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
* Largest County Turnout: Denver 
    * Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    * Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
    * Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
* Election Winner: Diana DeGette
    * Vote Count: 272,892
    * Percent of the vote: 73.8%

## Election-Audit Summary

We have written this simple python program to be used for auditing the election results. We could use this program for other elections, however the results file structure would have to be the same for the other elections, including the results being grouped by candidate and county.  There are some simple changes we could make that would make the audit program more flexible.  For example, we could utilize a variable for the results filenames and loop through multiple csv files in the Resources directory.  This would allow for different counties or precincts to have their results in different files.  Also, we could improve this program to check the header field and chose the column we pull the candidate and county (or precinct) name based on the name of the column specified in the header row.  Lastly, we could improve the program to display the percentages of votes each candidate received in each county, showing how the candidates performed in the different counties.  Hopefully you can see that the program is simple to use and automates the election audits easily, concisely displying the results for the user to see.
